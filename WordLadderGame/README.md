# Word Ladder Game

## Overview

The Word Ladder Game is a Java application created during my coursework that transforms a start word into an end word by changing one letter at a time, with each intermediate word being a valid English word. This project was created to practice algorithm design, data structures, and file I/O in Java.

## Features

- Builds valid word ladders using dictionary-based validation
- Supports both BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) approaches
- Validates input words against a lexicon
- Provides user-friendly error messages and result summaries

---

## Technologies & Concepts

- Java (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Data structures: queues, stacks, sets, and graphs
- Graph traversal algorithms (BFS and DFS)
- File input/output for lexicon handling
- Exception handling and input validation

---

## What I Learned

- WordLadderGame.java — Main class for user interaction and game logic
- Lexicon.java — Class to handle dictionary loading and word validation
- WordNode.java (or similar) — Helper class to represent nodes in the ladder
- Additional utility or helper classes as needed
