# Dense Bean Salad Randomizer

## Overview

A fun, Java-based randomizer that generates creative "dense bean salad" ingredient combinations. 
Designed as a playful project to experiment with randomization, basic UI/UX considerations, and showcase my creativity alongside technical skills.

## Features

- Generates random ingredient lists from a custom bean salad "database"
- Allows optional constraints (e.g., "must include chickpeas")
- Highlights playful, user-friendly messaging

---

## Technologies & Concepts

- Java (core syntax and object-oriented design)
- Collections (arrays, array lists, or sets)
- Random number generation
- Basic logic and user interaction principles
- Creative problem-solving and playful design
