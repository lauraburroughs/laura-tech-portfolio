# Word Search Game

## Overview

This is a Java-based Word Search Game designed as part of my coursework to practice object-oriented programming, and algorithms. I added a GUI as part of my independent skill development. The game allows players to search for valid words on a dynamic board, validating entries against a lexicon.
